To install the Max for Live device, drop the "8 Euclidean" folder in: Ableton/User Library/Presets/Midi Effects/Max MIDI Effects.

The patchers folder has a useful abstraction for converting sequences expressed as a list of binary digits (e.g. 0 1 0 0 1 0 1) into a format that what~ understands (e.g. 0.142857 0.571429 0.857143)
