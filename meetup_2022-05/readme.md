# May 26 2022 Meetup
Join the LA Max community at Coaxial Arts Foundation on May 26, 2022 at 7 PM. This is the first of a monthly series of meetups focused on the creation of music and multimedia art using the software Max by Cycling ‘74. The monthly series will feature workshops, talks, performances from artists and educators who use Max, plus free time and space to learn, patch, and hang out with others who love computer music and art.

This event is free and welcomes people of all skill levels, experiences, races, genders, sexual orientations, and nationalities. There will also be food and drink available for free. 

This month explores two building blocks for making rhythmic music with Max.

[Philip Meyer](https://philip-meyer.com/) will show how some of Max’s newest features MC and the brand-new objects what~ and subdiv~ can be used to build a multitrack sequencer in Max for Live. 

[Julian Stein](https://julianstein.net/about) will use the MuBu and PiPo libraries to demonstrate an analysis-based approach to audio sequencing, providing real-time techniques for slicing-up samples and rearranging them into new musical patterns.

If you plan to attend this event, please [RSVP](https://withfriends.co/event/14312311/max_meetup_los_angeles). RSVPs are not required, but it helps us make sure we have enough space, food, and volunteers to run a successful event.

Thanks to Cycling ‘74 and Coaxial Arts Foundation for supporting the Los Angeles Max Meetups.
