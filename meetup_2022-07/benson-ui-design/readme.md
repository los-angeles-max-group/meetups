# UI Design In Max/MSP Meetup Workshop

## Best Practices
- Always create projects in order to save and organize images
- Always consolidate files in projects
- Max sometimes produces unclear results when managing and loading images. Always save a copy of your images.
- Change the grid size to something divisible by 2. This makes it easier when creating and positioning graphics. I recommend 10. 10.
- Turn on Snap to Grid on Open and Snap to Grid.

## Cautions
- Max may produce inconsistent results when loading images
- Using 100% transparent images produces inconsistent results in Max. If you need invisible regions (buttons on top of images) then make the invisible region only 95% transparent.

## Each patch requires the use image files. Download the files below.
